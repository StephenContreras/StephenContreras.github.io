I graduated cum laude in 2018 with a focus in computer systems and cyber security.  By going through the computer engineering program I was able to learn deeper insights into the impact of computer hardware on the implementation of software and computer systems and reinforced the ability to context switch between lower level languages and ones with greater levels of abstraction. I was able to go from hand compiling C code to implementing an object oriented language via Haskell to data analysis in R to parallelizing software to run on A&M supercomputers.
